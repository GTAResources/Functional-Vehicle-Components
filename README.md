# Introduction
This is a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas modification which adds features/ functions to various vehicle components. Such as speedometer, odometer, chains and more. It requires [Moonloader](https://gtaforums.com/topic/890987-moonloader/) to work so see the installation [here](https://github.com/user-grinch/Cheat-Menu#installation).

The documentation on how to adapt your vehicles with the modification is [here](https://github.com/user-grinch/Functional-Vehicle-Components/wiki). It is still under alpha stages so huge breaking changes might occur.
